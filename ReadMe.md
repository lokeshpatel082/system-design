# Low-Level Design (LLD) Project

## Overview
This is a **Maven-based Java project** containing various **low-level design** implementations for real-world systems. Each system is encapsulated in its own module, allowing for easy understanding and maintainability. The designs follow **SOLID principles** and best practices of object-oriented programming.

## Project Structure
The project is organized in a modular fashion using Maven's multi-module architecture. Each module represents a specific design problem and contains all necessary classes and logic for that system.

### Current Modules
Coming Soon ...
